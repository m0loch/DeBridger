# DeBridger v0.4.9

## Source code
https://github.com/m0loch/DeBridger

## How to install
https://ui.vision/howto/install-chrome-extension-from-file

## Mobile
In order to install the extension on mobile, you'll need to install Kiwi Browser, as the other Chrome derivative browsers don't support extensions on mobile.

## Purpose
Sometimes the ignore list is just not enough to handle some trolls

## Features
- change the nickname of the troll (since we all know he's going to change his handle and/or get banned, _eventually_)
- customize the message you'll see instead of the garbage said user constantly posts
- option of just removing the post altogether

## Plans for the future
- multiple possible messages to randomly choose from when replacing the post

## Known issues
- if the user adds a VIP to the trolls list (i.e.: a moderator) then loads a page containing a post quoting said user, but no full post from them, the quoted message will be purged.
