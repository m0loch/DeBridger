# DeBridger v0.3.5

## Source code
https://github.com/m0loch/DeBridger

## Online package
https://mega.nz/file/yrBQDKzA#zBTBVybmfmdUduDRVZgvNID929zUGPM1wpcKzVrddLQ

## How to install
https://ui.vision/howto/install-chrome-extension-from-file

## Mobile
In order to install the extension on mobile, you'll need to install Kiwi Browser, as the other Chrome derivative browsers don't support extensions on mobile.

## Purpose
Sometimes the ignore list is just not enough to handle some trolls

## Features
- change the nickname of the troll (since we all know he's going to change his handle and/or get banned, _eventually_)
- customize the message you'll see instead of the garbage said user constantly posts
- option of just removing the post altogether

## Plans for the future
- clean posts quoting the troll as well
- extend the functionalities to a list of users (why just one at a time?)
- multiple possible messages to randomly choose from when replacing the post
