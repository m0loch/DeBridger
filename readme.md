## Online package

## How to install
https://ui.vision/howto/install-chrome-extension-from-file

## Mobile
In order to install the extension on mobile, you'll need to install Kiwi Browser, as the other Chrome derivative browsers don't support extensions on mobile.

## Purpose
Sometimes the ignore list is just not enough to handle some trolls

## Features
- change the nickname of the troll (since we all know he's going to change his handle and/or get banned, _eventually_)
- customize the message you'll see instead of the garbage said user constantly posts
- option of just removing the post altogether

## Plans for the future
- clean posts quoting the troll as well
- multiple possible messages to randomly choose from when replacing the post

## Change Log
- 0.4.6
  * now quotes get handles as well

- 0.4.5
  * added support for a list of trolls, rather than a single user
  * added some basic CSS styling to the options page
